# Digits Recognition

## Development an application that recognizes digits.

The goal of this project is development of the application that recognizes digits. The application learns
to recognize the printed digits (0 â€“ 9). The digits are created in the Paint application and stored in
BMP format. The main methods are used for recognition are: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG),
Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project is developed in C++ using OpenCV library. 
Also, the project includes HOG part developed in Python, demonstrating how the method works. 
See Course project.pdf for the details.
