# Digits Recognition
## AFEKA - Tel-Aviv Academic College Of Engineering<br/>Department: Intelligent Systems<br/>Course: Introduction To Intelligent Systems

**Course project:** Development an application that recognizes digits.<br/>
**Tools:** C++, OpenCV, Visual Studio 2017, Python, Spyder.<br/>

The goal of this project is development of the application that recognizes digits.<br/> 
The application learns to recognize the printed digits (0 â€“ 9).<br/>
The digits are created in the Paint application and stored in BMP format.<br/> 
The main methods are used for recognition are: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG),<br/>
Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project is developed in C++ using OpenCV library.<br/>
Also, the project includes HOG part developed in Python, demonstrating how the method works.<br/> 

See *"Course project.pdf"* for the details.
